<p class="text">Daily Living Expenses * Daily living expenses are those costs that pertain to everyday life such as groceries, auto insurance, gas, mortgage or rent, utilities, cell phone, Internet and cable. To figure out how much a person needs after retiring, he can first examine how much he spends as a worker. Different factors contribute to the need to adjust it up or down. Children who move out of the house reduce the expense. However, if he and his wife will be spending more time at home and eating more meals there, then the expense may rise. Be realistic in the adjustment.
Medical and Long-term Care * One expense that steadily increases in need and cost is medical and long-term care. As a person ages, he typically requires more visits to the doctor and more prescription medication. In the later years of his retirement, he may find a need for daily nursing care or living in a nursing home. Insurance planning can help to determine these costs and how to reduce the retiree's financial liability for each.</p>
